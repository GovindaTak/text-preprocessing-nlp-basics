# Text Preprocessing Basics in NLP  

## Overview  
This project serves as a foundational step into the world of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It focuses on various text preprocessing techniques required to prepare raw textual data for machine learning and deep learning models. The goal is to clean and transform the data into a structured format, enabling effective analysis and better performance in downstream tasks.

## Features  

### 1. **Text Preprocessing**  
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens for analysis.  
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all text to lowercase for uniformity.  
- **Punctuation and Special Character Removal**: Eliminating unnecessary characters from the text.  
- **Stopword Removal**: Removing commonly used words that provide minimal semantic value (e.g., "the", "is").  

### 2. **Stemming vs. Lemmatization**  
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root forms using algorithms like Porter or Snowball.  
- **Lemmatization**: Using **Spacy** to find the base forms of words, preserving the context and meaning.  

### 3. **Vocabulary Building**  
- Constructing a vocabulary of unique tokens from the dataset.  
- Analyzing word distributions and frequencies to understand the dataset better.  

### 4. **Text Vectorization**  
- **CountVectorizer**: Transforming text into numerical data based on token counts.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Assigning importance to words by weighing term frequency against document frequency.

## Project Structure  
- **Dataset**: Contains the sample text dataset used for preprocessing tasks.  
- **Notebook**: Includes step-by-step implementations of preprocessing techniques.  
- **Results**: Outputs and visualizations showcasing the effects of preprocessing steps.  

---

## Key Insights  
- Preprocessing steps such as **stopword removal** and **lowercasing** significantly improve model readiness.  
- **Lemmatization** is more effective than stemming in preserving word semantics.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** provides a better representation of text importance compared to simple count vectors.  

---

## Future Work  
- Add **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using Spacy.  
- Explore advanced tokenization techniques like **subword tokenization** (e.g., BERT tokenizer).  
- Expand vocabulary analysis with **word embeddings** like Word2Vec or GloVe.
